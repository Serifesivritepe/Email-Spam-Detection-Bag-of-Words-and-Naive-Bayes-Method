# Email-Spam-Detection-Bag-of-Words-and-Naive-Bayes-Method
This project uses Bag of Words (BoW) and a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam emails. It includes preprocessing like tokenization and vectorization, and evaluates the model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The system classifies emails as spam or not based on their content.
